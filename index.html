    <div class="wrapper">
      <p>Having menstrual cramps is one of the most common, annoying parts of your period. They can strike right before or during that time of the month. Many women get them routinely. You’ll feel these cramps in your lower belly or back. They can range from
        mild to severe. They usually happen for the first time a year or two after a girl first gets her period.
      </p>
      <p><strong>
            With age, they usually become less painful and may stop entirely after you have your first baby. Your doctor may call your cramps “dysmenorrhea.”

          <p>As a yoga instructor, I avoid medications, especially painkillers of any form and I’ve learnt to treat my menstrual cramps doing certain yoga poses, but unfortunately this is not always possible. I can’t do yoga when I am at work, or outside or attending some event…! But the MentoStop pads come in hand in this exact cases. They work effectively thanks to the natural ingredients that relieve the cramps as soon as I apply one one my abdomen. Applying is easy and completely they are invisible under my tight evening dress. I simply love them!</p>

          <p>From the very beginning of my menstrual cycle, it has always been very painful. Through the years I have tried so many “solutions”. Don’t get me wrong - I have no problems taking medications if they can help. But as soon as I would start taking certain painkiller, I seem to become resistant and it wouldn’t work for me anymore. A friend of mine told me about the MentoStop pads, I am used to testing new solutions, so I went on with them right away. That was 7 months ago - I have been using them ever since and the result is still they same - every time they relieve the pain so quickly. So far I haven’t discovered anything that effective, so I will surely keep on using them. </p>

          <h3>Anabel, 32, London</h3>
          <p>My worst nightmare are menstrual cramps - they always happen at the worst possible moment, when I can’t afford to lie down for a bit and rest. As I try not to take any pain relievers, it doesn’t leave me much of a choice, other than taking the pain. That was until my mother gave me a pack of MentoStop pads and assured me they work quickly, she was using them for quite some time. I was really sceptical they will work for me, I know that my cramps are unbearable and rarely anything helps (not even medications). I was so, SO surprised that only after 10 minutes I felt some relieve in the abdomen and the tension and pain were not so acute. A few minutes after that I couldn’t even remember I was in pain. I couldn’t be happier now, no more pain at that time of the month!</p>
